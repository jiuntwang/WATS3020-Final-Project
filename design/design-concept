## Design Concept

This webite will be a product page for an ficticious company that sells fancy handmade cat collars made in Seattle. The homepage will feature poloroid-esque images with captions underneath of cats wearing fancy collars to appeal to the "crazy cat lady" audience of ages 20-40 and of middle class income. The website will contain 6 pages: Homepage, About, Product, Gallery, FAQ, and Contact Us. 

A company name has not been decided as of 02/19/17. 

The logo and name will be simple and distinctive of what the product is and who its for (a fancy cat collar for cats). The style of the page will remain as a handcrafted/photo driven feel to emphasize that the product is also handmade. Colors will remain a neutral a pallete with some light pastel variations of cyan, magenta, and yellow. Font choice will be san-serif, clean, and easy to read.
