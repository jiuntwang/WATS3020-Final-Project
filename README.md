# WATS-3020-Final-Project

## Base Requirements

1. Come up with the concept for a single-page (at least) experience combining HTML, CSS, and JS.
2. Come up with a lovely design that does justice to your concept.
3. Implement your concept and design in HTML, CSS, and JS.
4. Be sure that your concept meets these technical requirements:
  1. Use at least **one third party library (probably jQuery) to assist with base dom manipulation** and programming.
  2. Use at least **one third party library (perhaps Bootstrap) to assist with some aspect of visual presentation** and/or visual effects (you could also use a third party animation library, etc.).
  3. Use at least **one third party library to incorporate data from a remote service.** (This could be implementation of a mapping library like Leaflet.js, some JS components for Flickr or Twitter, or a completely custom API request/feature that you create using "ajax()" or "getJSON()" methods.
  4. Use at least **one event listener to respond to a user's click.** (This could be doing a show/hide on content, simulating a login, triggering ..4. an animation, etc.)
  5. Your **design and layout must be responsive** for the four common sizes of screen: sm, md, lg, xl.


## Stretch Goals

Use an animation library to do a vertical scrolling animation.
Use another special library to make a very specific presentation that would not be possible without JavaScript.

#### This a four week project that involves: Design Planning, Mobile Friendly Layout Research, Preview, and Completion.
